Changed the last executed END statements to SYSTEM in each program.
This allows the program to return to DOS when run.
Wrote RUNALL.BAT file so that they could be simply run using the interpreter.  
RBK 5/9/95

Wrote CL.BAT and COMPLINK.BAT to compile all files.
The option used needs BRUN45.EXE in the directory - not stand alone.
This produces much shorter code.
BC /T option not known in basic compiler.
RUNALLEX.BAT runs all compiled programs. 
RBK 7/9/95

Can't break out of BAT file!
